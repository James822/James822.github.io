    <div class="post_title_heading">Introduction to Group Theory Part 2: Groups</div>
    <div class="post_title_subtext">2025 Mar 13, James Spratt <br> Category: <a href="/index.html">Mathematics</a></div>
  </div>

  <p>In the <a href="/posts/introduction_to_group_theory_and_permutations.html">last post</a> we introduced permutations and developed some basic results and theorems, especially with <i>compositions</i> of permutations. Many of the results that were developed for permutations can be generalized to other kinds of structures.</p>

  <p>As an example, we might want to consider doing "clock arithmetic", which is adding numbers on a 12-hour clock. This system of addition is not like the usual system of addition with integer numbers, as the numbers wrap around after 12. In this altered form of arithmetic, we get odd results such as 9 + 4 = 1 and 10 + 7 = 5. We also have "normal" equalities such as 3 + 2 = 5 and 5 + 6 = 11.</p>

  <p>Another example is the operations performed on a rubik's cube. We can rotate many of the pieces and move the colors around on the faces of the cube. We can also think about compositions of operations, and ask certain question about their properties.</p>

  <p>Permutations, clocks, and a rubik's cube have more in common than you might first think. All of these seemingly unrelated things can be understood to the same kind of structure; they share a common <b>essence</b>. This common essence is exactly that they are all groups! But what are groups? Let's give the group axioms and start talking about what they are.</p>

  
  
  <div class="he">Group Theory Axioms</div>
  <p>A <b>group</b> is a set or collection of objects \(G\), equipped with a binary operation "\(\bullet\)", that satifies the following axioms or properties:</p>

  <p><b>Axiom 1 - Closure of Binary Operation:</b></p>
  \[ \bullet : G \times G \to G \]
  
  <p><b>Axiom 2 - Associativity of Binary Operation:</b></p>
  \[ \forall a,b,c \in G : a \bullet (b \bullet c) = (a \bullet b) \bullet c \]
  
  <p><b>Axiom 3 - Existence of Identity Element:</b></p>
  \[ \exists e \in G : \forall a \in G : a \bullet e = e \bullet a = a \]
  
  <p><b>Axiom 4 - Existence of Inverse Element:</b></p>
  \[ \forall a \in G : \exists a^{-1} \in G : a \bullet a^{-1} = a^{-1} \bullet a = e \]

  <p>Let's break down what these axioms mean in words.</p>

  <p><b>Axiom 1</b> means that the binary operation "\(\bullet\)" is a function that takes a pair of any two elements from \(G\) and maps that pair to another element of \(G\). The operation is said to be "closed" because it never sends any elements outside of \(G\). The question remains of this binary operation is necessarily <i>surjective</i>, meaning that every element in \(G\) has a pair that maps to it.</p>

  <p><b>Axiom 2</b> is fairly straightforward, and just means that the order of bracketing expressions doesn't matter. If you have elements \(a,b,c \in G\), we can always write \(a \bullet b \bullet c\) with no confusion or ambiguity. Take care not to mistake this axiom for what is called <b>commutativity</b>, which is when \(a \bullet b = b \bullet a\), this is not true in general.</p>

  <p><b>Axiom 3</b> means that there is an identity element so that every element in \(G\) is "unchanged" by an operation with this identity element. It remains to be seen if this element is unique or not, but there is certainly at least one identity element.</p>

  <p><b>Axiom 4</b> means that for every element in \(G\), there is an inverse element that takes it back to the identity element with the group operation. At this point we cannot say if the inverse is unique to each element, or if there is one global inverse, but we know each element has at least one inverse.</p>

  <p>With just these 4 simple axioms, everything surrounding group theory follows from these basic properties. I find it rather elegant that so much nuance and complexity can be boiled down to very simple elements.</p>

  

  <div class="he">Examples of Groups</div>
  <p>Even just with these four axioms, some of these properties should look familiar with respect to permutations. We'll prove that permutations are a group along with "clock arithmetic" as two major examples.</p>

  <p>First, we are going to prove that the set of permutations form a group under the operation of function composition "\(\circ\)":</p>

  


  
  <div class="he">Basic Group Theorems</div>
  <p>There are number of important and basic results that we can prove from these axioms. We'll rigorously prove some of the basic theorems:</p>

  <div class="theorem">
    <p><b>THEOREM 1:</b> The binary operation "\(\bullet\)" is surjective, meaning that for every \(g \in G \), there exists \(a,b \in G\) such that \(a \bullet b = g\).</p>
    <p><i>proof:</i> By Axiom 3, for every element \(g \in G\), there exists an element \(e \in G\) so that \(g \bullet e = g\).</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">\( \square \)</p>
  </div>

  <p><b>THEOREM 2:</b> The identity element \(e\) is unique, meaning per group there is exactly one identity element \(e\).</p>
  <p><i>proof:</i> Let us assume that the there are two identity elements \(e_1\) and \(e_2\). Therefore by Axiom 3, for every \(a \in G\): \(a \bullet e_1 = a \bullet e_2 = a\):</p>
  \[ \begin{alignat*}{2}
  && a \bullet e_{1} &= a \bullet e_{2} && \quad \textrm{by our assumption}\\
  \Longrightarrow \quad && a^{-1} \bullet (a \bullet e_{1}) &= a^{-1} \bullet (a \bullet e_{2}) && \quad \text{rules of equality}\\
  \Longrightarrow \quad && (a^{-1} \bullet a) \bullet e_{1} &= (a^{-1} \bullet a) \bullet e_{2} && \quad \text{Axiom 2 - Associativity}\\
  \Longrightarrow \quad && e_{1} \bullet e_{1} &= e_{1} \bullet e_{2} && \quad \text{Axiom 4 - Inverse}\\
  \Longrightarrow \quad && e_{1} &= e_{2} && \quad \text{Axiom 3 - Identity}\\
  \end{alignat*} \]
  <p style="text-align: right;">\( \square \)</p>

  <p><b>THEOREM 3:</b> The inverse of each element is unique to that element. So for any \(a \in G\) : \([a \bullet (a^{-1})_1 = a \bullet (a^{-1})_2 = e] \Longrightarrow [(a^{-1})_1 = (a^{-1})_2]\)</p>
  <p><i>proof:</i> Let us assume that \(a \bullet a^{-1}_1 = a \bullet a^{-1}_2\):</p>
  \[ \begin{alignat*}{2}
  && a \bullet a^{-1}_1 &= a \bullet a^{-1}_2\\
  \Longrightarrow && a^{-1}_1 \bullet a \bullet a^{-1}_1 &= a^{-1}_1 \bullet a \bullet a^{-1}_2\\
  \end{alignat*} \]
  <p style="text-align: right;">\( \square \)</p>

  <p><b>THEOREM 4:</b> No two elements have the same inverse. For any \(a,b \in G\) with \(a \neq b\): if \(a \bullet a^{-1} = e\) and \(b \bullet b^{-1} = e\), then: \(a^{-1} \neq b^{-1}\).</p>
  <p><i>proof:</i> Let us assume that \(a \bullet a^{-1}_1 = a \bullet a^{-1}_2\):</p>
  \[ \begin{alignat*}{2}
  && a \bullet a^{-1}_1 &= a \bullet a^{-1}_2\\
  \Longrightarrow && a^{-1}_1 \bullet a \bullet a^{-1}_1 &= a^{-1}_1 \bullet a \bullet a^{-1}_2\\
  \end{alignat*} \]
  <p style="text-align: right;">\( \square \)</p>

  <p><b>THEOREM 5:</b> Every element \(a \in G\) is an inverse of another element, so there exists \(b \in G\) so that \(a \bullet b = e\). More specifically, \(b = a^{-1}\) and \((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\)</p>
  <p><i>proof:</i> the proof is trivial as \(a \bullet a^{-1} = a^{-1} \bullet a = e\), so \((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\).</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">\( \square \)</p>

  <p>Even though in different form, all of these axioms should seem familiar with respect to the permutations we have been discussing.</p>
  
  <p>All of this might seem very trivial to talk about, but consider a game that has 20 loading zones (which is not uncommon, and in fact many games have more), then the amount of permutations of 20 is 20 factorial, which is over 2 quintillion permutations, which is approximately 2 million terabytes of information! The growth of the factorial function is very bad, and it would be absurd to brute force this problem.</p>

  <p>Of course, most randomization algorithms will just pick permutations at random, but then they might not have certain properties that we would like. The naive approach would be to generate every permutation and search the permutations to find the desirable ones, but our results from group theory (especially k-cycles) makes it easy to select from literally billions of billions of combinations!</p>

  <div class="he">Further Applications</div>
  <p>In the case that several loading zones belong to the same area, we can treat them as a group.</p>

  <div class="he">Symmetric Group</div>
  <p>Before we even introduce the axioms of groups, we can start talking about a specific type of group called the <b>symmetric group</b>.</p>

  <p>The <b>symmetric group</b> for some non-negative integer <math><mi>n</mi></math> is the set of all permutations of <math><mi>n</mi></math>, and is defined formally as:</p>

  <math display="block"><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>σ</mi><mi>|</mi><mi>σ</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>1,2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo>→</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mn>1,2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></math>

  <p>Since the amount of permutations is <math><mi>n</mi><mo>!</mo></math> for any <math><mi>n</mi></math>, then: <math><mi>|</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mi>|</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>!</mo></math>, so the size of the symmetric group grows incredibly large even with fairly small values of <math><mi>n</mi></math>.</p>

  <p>For example, the symmetric group <math><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>20</mn></msub></math> is the number of permutations of the number <math><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn></math>, so we know that <math><mi>|</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mn>20</mn></msub><mi>|</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>20</mn><mo>!</mo></math>, which is over 2 quintillion permutations! That is approximately 2 million terabytes of information! The growth of the factorial function is very bad, and it would be absurd to brute force check all permutations for even some of the smallest numbers. Group theory can help reduce the complexity of studying permutations of very large numbers.</p>

  <p>In the next part, we'll start studying group theory proper with the group axioms and deriving properties and results from them.</p>

  <p>In fact, the elements of the set \( \langle \sigma \rangle\ \) behave the same as something we've seen before... cycles! We can even represent the elements of \( \langle \sigma \rangle\ \) as:</p>

  \[ \langle \sigma \rangle = \{e, \sigma^1, \sigma^2, \cdots, \sigma^{k-1}, \sigma^k \}\]

  <p>where \( \sigma^{k} = \sigma^{-1} \), so \( \sigma^{k+1} = e \). With this, we can consider the elements to be in a "cycle", writing them like this:</p>

  \[
  \begin{pmatrix}
  e & \sigma^1 & \sigma^2 & \cdots & \sigma^{k-1} & \sigma^{k}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \]

  <p>So each element is mapped to the next element by the rules:</p>

  \[ \sigma^r \mapsto \sigma^{r+1} \text{ if: } 0 \leq r < k, \sigma^r \mapsto e \text{ if: } r = k \]

  <p>This rule is amazing because it gives us a 1-to-1 correspondence with the the numbers \(r\) and the permutations \(\sigma^r\). We can represent this one-to-one correspondence as:</p>

  \[
  \begin{matrix}
  e & \sigma^1 & \sigma^2 & \cdots & \sigma^{k-1} & \sigma^{k}\\
  \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \updownarrow & \cdots & \updownarrow & \updownarrow\\
  0 & 1 & 2 & \cdots & k-1 & k
  \end{matrix}
  \]

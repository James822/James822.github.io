<div class="post_body">
  <p>In a <a href="/posts/x11_window_opengl.html">previous post</a> I made a tutorial showing how to get a window open on linux/X11 with an OpenGL context. I'd like to make the same tutorial but for windows now, so here it is.</p>

  <p>This tutorial follows the same format as the last one, so I won't really go into too much detail on things that I've already covered. I'm moreso only going to outline the windows/win32 aspects here, but don't worry, the full source code is available <a href="https://github.com/James822/win32-opengl-window">here</a> in my github repository.</p>

  <p>Just like the last tutorial, we'll be using C to do everything, but you can also follow along in C++ with only a few modifications.</p>



  
  <div class="he">Win32</div>
  <p>Unlike linux, everything we'll need for this tutorial is under the win32 API. The win32 API is the programming interface to the windows operating system. It gives us the ability to perform file I/O, allocate memory, and namely: create windows.</p>

  <p>As opposed to linux (or rather linux distributions), the windowing system is not seperate from the kernel or OS interface, but is provided as an integral part of win32. We'll shortly see the functions we can use to create and manage windows.</p>

  <p>If you had already read my previous tutorial for making a window on linux with GLX and X11, then win32 essentially combines all these things together into one interface. The equivalent to GLX on windows is called "WGL", or the "Windows Extension to OpenGL". There is no equivalent to a windowing system like X11 or wayland, as the windowing system is an integral part of win32.</p>



  
  <div class="he">Documentation</div>
  <p>The primary source of documentation is MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network). Technically, MSDN was removed and integrated into a new space called "Microsoft Learn", but everyone still refers to this portion of Microsoft Learn as what it used to be, which is MSDN.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Microsft Learn/MSDN is very disorganized. I would provide you a link, but that would be more unhelpful than just providing a few select links on specific topics.</p>

  <p>Along with MSDN, you should also have the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/index_gl.php">OpenGL registry</a> on hand.</p>
  



  <div class="he">Compiling/Building on Windows with MSVC</div>
  <p>MSVC or the "Microsoft Visual C++" compiler is the main C/C++ compiler for windows which we will be using. Even though it only has "C++" in the title, it also supports C compilation. When it comes to microsoft, almost nothing is named what it should be, and everything seems to be almost deliberately confusing. Bear with me, as it only gets worse the further into it you go. Many of the MSDN docs will refer to "C++" tutorials or references, but these also apply to plain C as well.</p>

  <p>MSVC is the compiler used in Visual Studio, and typically, people invoke it when they use the Visual Studio IDE. If you want to use VS that's up to you, but I'll demonstrate how to use MSVC from the command line directly which I find be easier to use, and it allows you to use whatever IDE you like. For this section, the primary reference will be this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170">MSDN documentation</a>.</p>

  <p>The first thing you need to do is grab the "Build Tools for Visual Studio" which is referenced in the MSDN doc, and can be found <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022">here</a>. This will give you the Visual Studio installer, which you should launch. You're going to want to select the "Desktop development with C++" install package, which is again poorly named, considering that it also gives us access to just plain C development tools. This install option is most likely all you'll need, but check the other options to see if you need something else. Again, just like we stated before, many of the tutorials/docs are named for C++ but are also for C as well, so don't worry.</p>

  <p>In order for these build tools to work, a lot of environment variables need to be set correctly, which in my opinion is a very bad design decision on the behalf of windows. Thankfully, they at least provided a fix for this issue by giving us our choice of specific developer CMDs, or by using a vcvars<>.bat shell script to setup and configure any CMD for proper use in compiling with MSVC. We will go with the vcvars<>.bat option for this tutorial, but you can also just use one of the developer command prompts which does the same thing.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, all of these configurations and environment variables are specific to the machine/installation that you are building on, so you can't just copy the developer command prompts or vcvars<>.bat files over to another machine/installation and expect it to work, because it probably won't. So basically, this process needs to be repeated each installation of windows. The vcvars<>.bat files can also vary from version to version, so from one VS version to the next, the location of the file and contents of the file might change. That being said, major version updates for VS don't come too often, but you should be looking to keep this process up to date at least a couple times or once per year.</p>

  <p>The location of these vcvars<>.bat files is dependent, but I found mine for VS 2022 in the following location: <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build</span>. The location can also be in many different places, such as the "Progam Files" without the x86, but this one is the correct one because it is under the "BuildTools" directory which corresponds to the Build Tools that I just referenced earlier in this tutorial for you to make sure to install. Again, windows is awful for this as there's multiple locations for these build files.</p>

  <p>We'll use the <span class="code_inline">vcvars64.bat</span> one because according to the MSDN docs: "Use the 64-bit x64-native tools to build 64-bit x64 code", so it builds us 64-bit code. DO NOT cut or copy this file anywhere else. These files are so delicate and I fear that even chaging the file location could screw it up because of how delicate these things are. The cwd doesn't seem to matter at least, but do not mess with these files as they are incredibly delicate as we will see soon.</p>

  <p>Then, run the vcvars<>.bat file only ONCE in the CMD you are using, then you can use the MSVC compiler. The vcvars<>.bat files are NOT meant to be run any more than ONE time in a given CMD, otherwise they will screw up the PATH environment variable among other environment variables. They will just add to it instead of properly changing it, so you can only run ONE of these per CMD window/instance and not more than once. A good idea would be to write a script that sets a variable to see if it has been run in your CMD already, so that it only runs it once.</p>

  <p>Once this is done in your CMD, MSVC is now avaible to run with "cl" or "cl.exe" as the compiler, and "link" or "link.exe" as the linker. These will be valid for the rest of the lifetime of the CMD you are in.</p>


  

  <div class="he">Windows SDK and Installing (OpenGL) Headers</div>
  <p>Before we do anything else, we should also install headers.</p>

  <p>The latest Windows SDK (also confusingly called "Windows Kits" for who knows what reason) is usually installed on your system when you install the Build Tools for Visual Studio as outlined above. The SDK contains many headers, such as the OpenGL headers, which we will need for this tutorial.</p>

  <p>OpenGL extension headers are not included for whatever reason (glext.h, wglext.h, etc.), so you need to manually install them yourself. Any headers you want to install can be done manually with this method:</p>

  <p>Find the location of the Windows SDK, which on my machine is installed in the location: <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\</span>, which is confusing as they use the name "Windows Kits" instead of what should be "Windows SDK".</p>

  <p>I found the headers in the <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\</span> subfolder which probably refers to Windows 10 (as that is the OS being used at the time of writing this post). The headers, library files, and many other important files are here for windows development.<p>

  <p>For example, the OpenGL headers are in the location: <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.22621.0\um\gl\</span> where <span class="code_inline">10.0.22621.0</span> is the latest SDK that was installed when installing the Build Tools for Visual Studio. You can drag and drop extension headers such as <span class="code_inline">glext.h</span> or <span class="code_inline">wglext.h</span> in here, and then it will add it to your system headers which will be recognized as <span class="code_inline">&lt;gl/glext.h&gt;</span> and <span class="code_inline">&lt;gl/wglext.h&gt;</span>. (NOTE: Windows/NTFS doesn't care about case in filenames, so "Windows.h" = "windows.h" = "WINDOWS.h", etc. By default, prefer lowercase).</p>

  <p>You'll need to add the <span class="code_inline">khrplatform.h</span> header as well to your system as <span class="code_inline">glext.h</span> depends on <span class="code_inline">&lt;khr/khrplatform.h&gt;</span> being a valid location. This is easy, just create a <span class="code_inline">khr</span> folder in the <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.22621.0\um\</span> directory and then place the <span class="code_inline">khrplatform.h</span> file in that folder so that the location looks like this: <span class="code_inline">C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.22621.0\um\khr\khrplatform.h</span>. Then, the system include <span class="code_inline">&lt;khr/khrplatform.h&gt;</span> or equivalently <span class="code_inline">&lt;KHR/khrplatform.h&gt;</span> will be recognized by MSVC.</p>

  <p>You can also just place your headers in your local project folder, and then add the path to MSVC with the <span class="code_inline">/I</span> flag, but I prefer this method with installing it manually in the Windows SDK (or "Windows Kits") location as it keeps it all in one place, and is current to the specific version of the SDK you use. If you get a new SDK version, you'll need to repeat this process.</p>



  
  <div class="he">Starter Code and Compilation with cl.exe (MSVC)</div>
  <p>Once you have the headers installed and a CMD open and have run the vcvars<>.bat file (or if you have a developer command prompt, which does the same thing), type <span class="code_inline">cl</span> or <span class="code_inline">cl.exe</span> in your CMD and you should get output like this:</p>

<div class="code_block">Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.43.34809 for x64

usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ]</div>

  <p>Otherwise, if you get some kind of error like this:</p>

<div class="code_block">'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.</div>

  <p>Then that means you haven't run the vcvars<>.bat file (or you aren't using a developer CMD).</p>

  <p>Once you have cl.exe available and ready, we can finally compile a basic starter "Hello World" program to make sure everything is setup correctly. Start with this C code and name it something like "win32_window.c":</p>

  <div class="he">Dummy Window/Context</div>
  <p>Before we jump into anything else, I need to make something clear about a certain quirk on windows that you need to be aware of when it comes to OpenGL.</p>
  
  <p>For 2 reasons on windows, it is neccessary to create both a "dummy" window & GL context. We will need to first create the dummy window, get a dummy (legacy) OpenGL context, and then use that dummy GL context to load the necessary extension procedures to create a modern core-profile GL context.</p>

  <p>The procedure that we need to create a modern core-profile OpenGL context is mainly <span class="code_inline">wglCreateContextAttribsARB</span>, and also a few others. The problem here is that we can't load these extension procedures unless we <i>already</i> have an OpenGL context! The procedure loading function on windows is <span class="code_inline">wglGetProcAddress</span>, and it requires a context to be current in order to function properly. In fact, the MSDN docs say that the function pointers returned by <span class="code_inline">wglGetProcAddress</span> are only valid given a current-context, and it may not be valid for any other contexts.</p>

  <p>So how do we solve this apparent Catch-22? The answer is that we are still able to create a <i>legacy</i> OpenGL context as windows provides legacy GL functions to do so, namely <span class="code_inline">wglCreateContext</span>. Once we have this GL context and have made it current, we can then use it to query for and load procedures that we use to create the new or <i>modern</i> OpenGL context, and then we can get rid of the old one.</p>

  <p>Along with that, windows only allows us to set the pixel format of a window once. If we want to change the pixel format of window, we can't. The only way to change pixel formats is to create a new window. Since it is required to set a pixel format for a window to get an OpenGL context, we need to set the pixel format of the window and <i>then</i> use that window to create the dummy (legacy) GL context. This would be all fine, except that modern GL context creation has extended pixel formats that we will want to support, with extension functions provided such as <span class="code_inline">wglChoosePixelFormatARB</span> to give us more options for pixel formats. So because of all those reasons, we also find it necessary to create a new window to take advantage of new pixel formats that come with modern GL.</p>

  <p>So in short, because of both the nature of loading procedures requiring an existing context AND pixel formats only being able to be set once; we need a dummy window AND a dummy GL context, of which both we will destroy once we have the "real" window and "real" GL context.</p>



  
  <div class="he">Dummy Window/Context Creation</div>
  <p>Finally we can start doing some real work!</p>

  <p>In order to create the dummy window and dummy GL context, you can use this code:</p>

  <p>The first we thing we need to do is create a window class for the dummy window and register it with <span class="code_inline">RegisterClassA()</span>. Window classes in win32 are basically just window information for a window class, they don't really serve much of a purpose beyond the fact that they can be reused across more than one window. We won't be doing such thing, so we'll create the window class for our dummy window.</p>

  <p>We also need to pass in a pointer to the <span class="code_inline">RegisterClassA()</span> function that specifies something called the "window procedure", a special callback that we must register for each window. This window callback is a function called by the OS which receives all kinds of events or messages that we need to handle.</p>

  <p>Since this is a dummy window that we will destroy, we don't actually need to worry about how to handle the window procedure so much, so we can just write the function with <span class="code_inline">DefWindowProc()</span> which is the "default window procedure" provided to us by win32 that automatically handles every message:</p>

<div class="code_block">LRESULT CALLBACK DummyGL_WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
      return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</div>

<p>Then, we can pass <span class="code_inline">DummyGL_WindowProc</span> to the <span class="code_inline">RegisterClassA()</span> which will register this window callback to the one used for any windows created with this window class. We will go over what the Window Procedure is and how to write it in more detail later, but for the dummy window, we just need default behaviour as we'll never actually use the window for anything else besides getting a context. The user of this application will never see the dummy window.<p>

  <p>Next, we then create the dummy window with <span class="code_inline">CreateWindowA()</span>, and we also grab the window DC (device context) which is necessary for context creation.</p>

  <p>To create an OpenGL context in windows, we need to first set a pixel format. We choose it first with <span class="code_inline">ChoosePixelFormat()</span>, and then set it with <span class="code_inline">SetPixelFormat()</span> which is set per-window. Even though we pass in the device context to this function, it refers to our window.</p>

  <p>Right from the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-setpixelformat">MSDN docs</a>:</p>

  <div class="qte">If hdc references a window, calling the SetPixelFormat function also changes the pixel format of the window. Setting the pixel format of a window more than once can lead to significant complications for the Window Manager and for multithread applications, so it is not allowed. An application can only set the pixel format of a window one time. Once a window's pixel format is set, it cannot be changed.</div>

  <p>So this is what is behind the reason for needing a dummy window, as we will see that when we load the extension procedures for extension pixel formats, we need a fresh window to set a new pixel format.</p>

  <p>The next thing we do after that is create the dummy context with the wgl function <span class="code_inline">wglCreateContext()</span> which just takes in our window DC. Then, we need to make it current with <span class="code_inline">wglMakeCurrent()</span> so that we can start loading procedures.</p>



  
  <div class="he">Loading WGL Extension Procedures</div>
  <p>Now that we have our (legacy) dummy GL context, we can load the important procedures that will be neccessary for a modern core-profile GL context.</p>

  <p>There are three extensions that we need to create a new context: <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_extensions_string</span>, <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_pixel_format</span>, and <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_create_context_profile</span>.</p>

  <p>The first extension, <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_extensions_string</span>, is important as it gives us the procedure <span class="code_inline">wglGetExtensionsStringARB()</span> which gives us the ability to query what extensions are available.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, due to some oversight, <span class="code_inline">wglGetExtensionsStringARB()</span> is not provided statically, so we just have to load it and hope that it is present, otherwise we have no ability to query what extensions are available. This is also another Catch-22 situation, as we need the <span class="code_inline">wglGetExtensionsStringARB()</span> function to be present in order to query if extensions are present, including <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_extensions_string</span>. GLX handles this much better as there is a statically provided <span class="code_inline">glXQueryExtensionsString</span> which does the same thing.</p>

  <p>So, we just try to load <span class="code_inline">wglGetExtensionsStringARB()</span> and hope that it is available. As for <i>how</i> to load extension procedures, we use the wgl function <span class="code_inline">wglGetProcAddress()</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="code_inline">wglGetProcAddress()</span> apparently does not function as documented in MSDN, as according to this <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Load_OpenGL_Functions">Khronos wiki entry</a>:</p>

  <div class="qte">While the MSDN documentation says that wglGetProcAddress returns NULL on failure, some implementations will return other values. 1, 2, and 3 are used, as well as -1.</div>

  <p>So, we wrap <span class="code_inline">wglGetProcAddress()</span> in our function <span class="code_inline">Load_WGL_Proc()</span> like this:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* Loads the specified GL/WGL function with the name "proc_name" using wglGetProcAddress(). Returns NULL on failure, otherwise non-NULL for success.
*/
void* Load_WGL_Proc(const char* proc_name)
{
      void* proc = NULL;
      proc = (void *)wglGetProcAddress(proc_name);
      if(proc == 0 || proc == (void *)1 || proc == (void *)2 || proc == (void *)3 || proc == (void *)-1) {
	    return NULL;
      }
      return proc;
}
</div>

  <p>We also need a function to parse the extension string as it is a space-seperated list of extensions names (there are no spaces in an extension name). In python, this might be a simple one-liner, but in C, it takes a bit more work. My implementation is here, I call the function <span class="code_inline">Check_Extension_Available()</span>:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* Returns 1 if extension is available, otherwise 0 if it is not present.

This function expects "extensions_lists" to be a space seperated list of GL (or platform, e.g. WGL/GLX) extensions, and it searches extensions_lists to find if the extension "extensions" is within it.
 */
static int Check_Extension_Available(const char* extensions_list, const char* extension)
{
      int i = 0;
      char c = extensions_list[i];
      while(c != '\0') {
	    if(c == extension[0]) {
		  if(i > 0) { /* i > 0 (i != 0) means we need to ensure the previous char is a space */
			if(extensions_list[i - 1] != ' ') {
			      break;
			}
		  }

		  /* now we check to see if the rest of the string after matches */
		  int equal = 1;
		  int j = 0;
		  while(extension[j] != '\0') {
			if(extensions_list[i + j] == '\0') {
			      equal = 0;
			      break;
			}
			if(extensions_list[i + j] != extension[j]) {
			      equal = 0;
			      break;
			}
			j += 1;
		  }
		  
		  if(equal == 1 && (extensions_list[i + j] == ' ' || extensions_list[i + j] == '\0') ) {
			return 1;
		  }
	    }

	    i += 1;
	    c = extensions_list[i];
      }

      
      return 0;
}</div>

  <p>I don't claim this is the best or most secure, it's just what I quickly wrote up.</p>

  <p>The second extension: <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_pixel_format</span>, gives us the procedures needed to create new types of pixel formats mainly with the procedure: <span class="code_inline">wglChoosePixelFormatARB()</span>.</p>

  <p>The third extensions: <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_create_context_profile</span>, gives us the important function <span class="code_inline">wglCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> which is what is used to actually create the modern core-profile OpenGL context.</p>

  <p>Now we are ready to create the real GL context!</p>



  
  <div class="he">Window Procedure</div>
  <p>Before we do indeed create the real window and real GL context, we need to revisit the window procedure.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, win32 is designed in a way so that it is necessary to have a window procedure callback that you must define so that it can handle potentially <i>thousands</i> of different kinds of messages. A typical window procedure might look like the following:</p>
  
<div class="code_block">LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (uMsg)
    {
    case WM_DESTROY:
        PostQuitMessage(0);
        return 0;

    case WM_PAINT:
        {
            PAINTSTRUCT ps;
            HDC hdc = BeginPaint(hwnd, &ps);

            // All painting occurs here, between BeginPaint and EndPaint.

            FillRect(hdc, &ps.rcPaint, (HBRUSH) (COLOR_WINDOW+1));

            EndPaint(hwnd, &ps);
        }
        return 0;

    }
    return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}    
</div>

  <p>where you either decide to intercept messages yourself, or let them be handled by the Default Window Procedure <span class="code_inline">DefWindowProc()</span>.</p>

  <p>Microsoft doesn't even document these messages properly, with their documentation being scattered all over MSDN and not in a central place. Luckily, the folks over at WINE have taken it upon themselves do to so which can be found <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/wikis/Wine-Developer's-Guide/List-of-Windows-Messages">here</a>.</p>

  <p>What's not so great is that the window procedure can be called by windows (the OS) at <i>any time</i> and there is no way of predicting when! Rather than just having a simple message loop that blocks until it gets messages, the creators behind win32 alos opted to go for a callback design with the window procedure message, which is nothing less than an awful design choice no matter what historical context prompted it.</p>

  <p>The window procedure can either be called in the message loop by <span class="code_inline">DispatchMessage()</span>, which is a function we will call (we'll get to the message loop later), OR, it can be called at any point by the OS. There are essentially two different event-handling paradigms (callback/queued) that are both present in win32. This is the worst of both worlds, not the best.</p>

  <p>There is also absolutely no clear and cut way to know what messages you should handle, whether you should intercept some and handle completely yourself, or if you should handle it and <i>then</i> pass it to the default window procedure - OR - if you should only use the default window procedure period. Since we don't have the source code for <span class="code_inline">DefWindowProc()</span>, half the time we just have to guess what it does, as most of the documentation for it is in the MSDN description for a message and is usually vague and somtimes completely absent.</p>

  <p>What's even worse is that if you choose not to handle some messages, your window or application will break in completely unpredictable ways, as the message model that win32 operates on is very odd in several places. Sometimes messages will be passed in for purely informational purposes (such as when a window is created), but you still have to return a specific value otherwise certain functions will break (such as <span class="code_inline">CreateWindow()</span>).</p>

  <p>What the OS is essentially doing is "recruiting" our process (specifically the thread the window was created in) to do the window processing that it should be handling itself. This is a terrible design decision and could have only ever been cooked up by microsoft. It is overly complex and very error-prone, with absolutely no benefit.</p>

  <p>Rather than handling it in the OS (where it should be) a lot of critical default behaviour is offloaded onto your thread, which causes unexpected behaviour that can be bad in very subtle ways. See this <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/1059">link</a> for example of how much of a headache this caused for the folks at SDL. This is just one particular example.</p>

  <p>All of this <i>might</i> be acceptable if it was well-documented exactly what the default window procedure does, as we are essentially forced into calling it on our own process thread, rather than the OS handling itself (which it should). But of course, as we would expect, the documentation for <span class="code_inline">DefWindowProc()</span> is spread out all over MSDN for each message (there are thousands of messages!). Most of the time, only vague descriptions are given as to what the default window procedure does, which is next to useless.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, the folks at WINE have once again come to the rescue and they have reverse engineered the default window procedure which can be found <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/blob/master/dlls/win32u/defwnd.c#L2388">here</a>.</p>

  <p>To deal with all of this nonsense, we basically just have to call the default window procedure, and try to figure out which cases we need to handle ourselves. This is a tedious trial-and-error process and is unfortunately the only way to go. Once again, absolutely terrible design on the behalf of microsoft.</p>

  <p>On the bright side, we can learn from existing codebases (such as the reverse-engineered one in WINE) for how to write our window procedures.</p>

  <p>The implementation we will use for this tutorial is given here:</p>

  <p>Creating the window is the same as before, except that this is the real window so you want to set properties knowing that it's the one that will be visible. After window creation, we grab the window DC again which will be used in creation of the real context.</p>

  <p>Now, we can create the new GL context which is where our new extensions come into play.</p>

  <p>We need to specify an attribute list: <span class="code_inline">pi_attrib_list</span>, which we set to have a number of important properties. This attribute list will be used in creation of our new pixel format with the <span class="code_inline">wglChoosePixelFormatARB()</span> function, and is the main reason why we needed this extension function in the first place. With this attribute list we can also choose double buffering and/or MSAA, which was not possible with the legacy context.</p>

  <p>Then, we use <span class="code_inline">DescribePixelFormat()</span> to get a pixel descriptor, and then pass that to <span class="code_inline">SetPixelFormat()</span> so that we can finally set the pixel format for this window.</p>

  <p>We then create the context with <span class="code_inline">wglCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> which we loaded prior, passing in an attribute list to specify the version of OpenGL we will be using and some other things.</p>

  <p>Once we are done that, we cleanup the old dummy window and dummy context as we no longer need it. Right after that, we finally make the new GL context current with <span class="code_inline">wglMakeCurrent()</span> and now we have a modern OpenGL context created current to our thread!</p>

  <p>Technically we're done at this point as we have a modern GL context now, but there's still more to go over.</p>

  


  <div class="he">Loading WGL Extension Procedures (Again)</div>

  <p>Now that we have a new context, we should reload any procedures that we had in the previous context.

  <p>Once this is done, we'll be able to render a simple triangle to the screen in our main loop, which we'll talk about next.</p>

  <p>Before we do that, we should set the GL viewport with <span class="code_inline">glViewport()</span> and also show our window with <span class="code_inline">ShowWindow()</span> so that it is visible:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ setting glViewport() */
RECT window_size;
GetClientRect(window_handle, &window_size);

glViewport(0, 0, window_size.right - window_size.left, window_size.bottom - window_size.top);
/* @! */


/* @@ Finally at the end, we show the window, similar to XMapRaised() or XMapWindow() for X11 */
ShowWindow(window_handle, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
/* @! */</div>

  <p>The window is technically visible at this point, but the application will return almost as soon as it starts so we might not see it. To see our window (and also render the triangle), we need to write the main loop.</p>




  <div class="he">Main Event/Message Loop & Cleanup</div>
  <p>Now we need to write the main event or message loop which will process window messages and also do rendering.</p>

  <p>The code is as follows:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ main loop */
MSG msg;
while(program_running) {	    
      /* @@ flush/process/get messages */
      while(PeekMessageA(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE) != 0) {
	    if(LOWORD(msg.message) == WM_QUIT) {
		  program_running = 0;
		  break;
	    }

	    TranslateMessage(&msg);		  
	    DispatchMessage(&msg);
      }
      /* @! */


      /* @@ rendering */
      glClearColor(0.1f, 0.15f, 0.19f, 1.0f);
      glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
      glUseProgram(shader_program);
      glBindVertexArray(vao);
      glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
      /* @! */


      /* @@ swapping and synching */
      wglSwapLayerBuffers(window_DC, WGL_SWAP_MAIN_PLANE);
      glFinish(); /* blocks until all previous GL commands finish, including the buffer swap. */
      /* @! */
}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>There's not much that's different here than on other platforms, besides of course the <span class="code_inline">PeekMessageA()</span> message loop. Basically, we get all the messages of the queue and process them one-by-one. <span class="code_inline">DispatchMessageA()</span> is the function that actually sends our message to the window procedure <span class="code_inline">WindowProc()</span>. Keep in mind that not all messages are sent with <span class="code_inline">DispatchMessageA()</span>, many are just sent directly to the window procedure.</p>

  <p>Lastly, once the main loop exits, we need to cleanup everything and return:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ Cleanup and Exit */
if(wglMakeCurrent(window_DC, NULL) != TRUE) { /* making WGL context not current */
      printf("ERROR: wglMakeCurrent() failed to make context NOT current\n");
}
if(wglDeleteContext(wgl_context) != TRUE) { /* deleting WGL context */
      printf("ERROR: wglDeleteContext() failed to delete WGL context\n");
}
if(DeleteDC(window_DC) == 0) { /* deleting window device context */
      printf("ERROR: DeleteDC() failed to delete window Device Context\n");
}
if(DestroyWindow(window_handle) == 0) {
      DWORD win32_error_val = GetLastError();
      printf("ERROR: failed to destroy window with DestroyWindow() - win32 error code: %ld\n", win32_error_val);
}
if(UnregisterClassA(window_class_name, hInstance) == 0) { /* unregistering window class */
      printf("ERROR: UnregisterClassA() failed to unregister window class: %s\n", window_class_name);
}


return 0;
/* @! */</div>

  <p>And that's it! Once you have this working, you're on your way to program native OpenGL applications on windows!</p>

  <br><div class="he">Group Theory Axioms</div>
  <p>We've now reach a good point where we can actually start talking about group theory proper, and in fact most of our notation and results that we showed with permutations generalizes quite well to any kind of group in general. </p>

  <p>A <b>group</b> is a set <math><mi>G</mi></math> equipped with a binary operation "<math><mo>∙</mo></math>" that satifies the following axioms or properties:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><b>Axiom 1 : Closure</b></dt>
    <dd><math><mo>∙</mo><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>G</mi></math>, this means that the binary operation is "closed", so it stays within <math><mi>G</mi></math>.</dd>
    <dt><b>Axiom 2 : Associativity</b></dt>
    <dd><math><mo>∀</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>G</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∙</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>∙</mo><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∙</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>∙</mo><mi>c</mi></math>, the binary operation must be associative (but not necessarily commutative).</dd>
    <dt><b>Axiom 3 : Identity</b></dt>
    <dd><math><mo>∃</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>G</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mo>∀</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>G</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>∙</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∙</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi></math>, so there must exists an identity element.</dd>
    <dt><b>Axiom 4 : Inverse</b></dt>
    <dd><math><mo>∀</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>G</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mo>∃</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>∈</mo><mi>G</mi><mo lspace="0.2222em" rspace="0.2222em">:</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∙</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>∙</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>e</mi></math>, every group element has an identity element.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Even though in different form, all of these axioms should seem familiar with respect to the permutations we have been discussing.</p>
  
  <p>All of this might seem very trivial to talk about, but consider a game that has 20 loading zones (which is not uncommon, and in fact many games have more), then the amount of permutations of 20 is 20 factorial, which is over 2 quintillion permutations, which is approximately 2 million terabytes of information! The growth of the factorial function is very bad, and it would be absurd to brute force this problem.</p>

  <p>Of course, most randomization algorithms will just pick permutations at random, but then they might not have certain properties that we would like. The naive approach would be to generate every permutation and search the permutations to find the desirable ones, but our results from group theory (especially k-cycles) makes it easy to select from literally billions of billions of combinations!</p>

  <br><div class="he">Further Applications</div>
  <p>In the case that several loading zones belong to the same area, we can treat them as a group.</p>

<div class="post_body">
  <p>Let me start off by saying that it's not that difficult to open a native window with no libraries or other extra help. Sure, it's not as easy as using a library like SDL, but it's also not so complicated that you can't at least understand how it works. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for SDL and other similar libraries such as GLFW, but it's certainly a good thing to at least understand how these libraries operate.</p>

  <p>Chances are that if you're here, you're already pursuing something plenty difficult enough that manually opening a native window and creating an OpenGL context is not something that deters you anyways, but I still emphasize that it is not difficult to do so. I also consider the proposition that doing this is a "waste of time" to be absurd, and one that could only come from a place of ignorance, perpetrated by people who lack understanding of how to do it themselves.</p>

  <p>In fact, this generally negative attitude towards "low-level" programming among the software people community is the exact reason why documentation is generally scarce on this subject, precisely because everyone just uses a library and thus few people know how to do it manually. It's quite sad that new and curious programmers are discouraged to delve into native programming by so-called "senior software engineers", who themselves only issue these warnings out of their own ignorance and incompetence. Either way, it is the sparsity of documentation surrounding this subject that has prompted me to write this tutorial and give a full overview of what is needed to get started.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, an important reason why I am making this tutorial is because the existing ones surrounding this subject are also full of error. I claim to have found some important errors that would set back new developers quite a bit, and I'll go over exactly what these errors are in this tutorial. Still, I'm grateful for the tutorials that exist and have referenced them extensively in this post.</p>

  <p>Alright, let's actually get into to it!</p>


  
  <div class="he">X11 & GLX</div>
  <p>To talk about opening a native window on any platform we need to understand what the native windowing system is. In the case of Microsoft *Windows*, the windowing system is built into the general platform API known as win32. In the case of linux, windowing systems are seperate from the kernel (properly speaking, seperate from linux itself), but the most widely used windowing system across different linux distributions is <b>X11</b> by far. Wayland is another option, but I won't be touching that.</p>

  <p>X11, or <i>The X Window system</i> is a bitmap display system based on a client-server architecture with a specified protocol called the "X Protocol". Applications communicate to the X Sever (which may be on the same device, or across a network) with commands to peform actions.</p>

  <p>Programming X11 is therefore writing a client application that can communicate with an X11 server, via the X Protocol. Typically, the X sever is on the same device as the client, and in fact we will be counting on that in our OpenGL application as we don't want to consider networked graphics applications.</p>

  <p>It is within possibility to learn the X Protocol and manually implement it within your client application, but this is beyond what I would consider practical. Rather than that, Xlib is provided for us as a C library that implements the X Protocol so that we can communicate between server and client with an API interface. This is the option I will be going with for this tutorial, but the X protocol is standardized and you absolutey could go look at it for yourself.</p>

  <p>In order to create and use an OpenGL context, we will need an extension to X11/Xlib called <b>GLX</b>, or the <i>OpenGL extension to the X Window System</i>, which is what allows us to create a framebuffer and use it within an OpenGL context. If we were on windows, we would use win32/WGL. GLX is what allows us to do most of the important work to link our X11 Window and OpenGL context so that we can start doing graphics rendering.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Documentation for X11/Xlib and GLX</div>
  <p>It's important to be aware of the documentation for the two main APIs involved here, X11/Xlib, and GLX, of which GLX is really just an API extension to Xlib.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the documentation for creating a window and GL context with Xlib/GLX is rather spread out all over the place. Further, the documentation that does exist is poor and outdated in some areas, which is part of the motivation for me making this tutorial.</p>

  <p>The Xlib documentation is found here: <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation/">https://www.x.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation/</a>, and the GLX documentation is found within the Khronos OpenGL registry here: <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/index_gl.php">https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/index_gl.php</a>. Even though GLX is a library extension to Xlib, it is listed in the OpenGL Registry which can be somewhat confusing. Out of all the documentation cited in this post, GLX is easily the worst, so I'll do my best to explain it. You should really grab the documentation for Xlib, GLX, and also the OpenGL core spec as well, which can also be found in the Khronos OpenGL registry.</p>

  <p>GLX 1.4 is the latest version and the one we will be using, but the documentation for it is outdated and flawed in many ways. It appears that the maintainers have given up on updating it since probably the early 2010s. For example, this documentation here: <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear.txt">https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear.txt</a> suggests edits and additions to the GLX 1.4 spec that are not actually present. If you grab the latest spec you won't find these additions or changes anywhere. There are several other examples where these proposed "additions" are not to be found anywhere with the GLX 1.4 spec found in the Khronos OpenGL registery. It's possible that these extensions were intended for the next version of GLX, so "GLX 1.5", but that never came so we are left with somewhat of a mess.</p>

    <p>What this really means for us is that we just need to read the extension documentation alongside the GLX 1.4 spec, which is not really that bad.</p>


    
  <div class="he">Starter Program and Compilation with GCC</div>
  <p>I'm going to be compiling with GCC and be using C, but you can also follow along in C++ with only a few modificaitions. If you read the Xlib documentation you'll note that most functions are provided as Macros, this is exactly so that either C or C++ can use the macro and get the right function. I just call the functions directly personally.</p>

  <p>Anyways, start with this C code, and name it something like "x11_window.c":</p>

<div class="code_block">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
  
int main()
{
      printf("Hello World!\n");
      return 0;
}</div>


  <p>then, compile with this command:</p>

<div class="code_block">gcc x11_window.c -o x11_window</div>

  <p>run it with:</p>

  <div class="code_block">./x11_window</div>

  <p>and you should get "Hello World!" as output.</p>

  <p>Also, at the end of the main function add a cleanup section like this:</p>

  <div class="code_block">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
    
int main()
{
      printf("Hello World!\n");


 CLEANUP_AND_EXIT:
      return 0;
}</div>

  <p>for now the cleanup section just returns from the main function. We'll be referring back to this cleanup section later.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Setting up X11 Display</div>
  <p>The first task is to open a connection to the X11 Display Server, the <i>X Server</i>. If no server exists on the host machine (or on the network if we specify a device across the network), then this will fail and we will have no way of displaying anything. We NEED an X server to have an X window, so either prompt the user to install/run the X server or something else.</p>

  <p>Anyways, we can open a connection to the X server and get a Display back using the <span class="code_inline">XOpenDisplay()</span> function.</p>

    <div class="code_block">/* @@ opening connection to X server */
Display* display = NULL;
int display_exists = FALSE;
int default_screen_id = 0;

display = XOpenDisplay(NULL);
if(display == NULL) {
      printf("ERROR: failed to open X11 display, display name: \"%s\"\n", XDisplayName(NULL));
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
} else {
      display_exists = TRUE;
      default_screen_id = XDefaultScreen(display);
}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>make sure to also have <span class="code_inline">#include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;</span> and also link to X11 with GCC by adding the flag: <span class="code_inline">-lX11</span>.</p>

  <p>This code snippet opens a connection to the X Server, and if it succeeds, also grabs the screen ID which we will need later. <span class="code_inline">NULL</span> is passed in to <span class="code_inline">XOpenDisplay()</span> which will give us the default display and screen of the device we are on.</p>

  <p>In the cleanup section, we need to close the display with <span class="code_inline">XCloseDisplay()</span> like this:</p>

<div class="code_block">     /* @@ cleanup and program exit */
CLEANUP_AND_EXIT:
     if(display_exists == TRUE) {
	   XCloseDisplay(display);
     }

     return 0;
     /* @! */</div>

  <p>And that's it for now.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Setting up GLX</div>
  <p>Before we open an X11 window or do anything else, we should query X to see if GLX is supported. We do that using the <span class="code_inline">glXQueryExtension()</span> function, and we also need to include GLX with: <span class="code_inline">#include &lt;GL/glx.h&gt;</span>. We also need to link to GLX with GCC using: <span class="code_inline">-lGLX</span>.</p>

  <p>The basic code for setting up GLX is like this:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ glx initial setup */
int error_base;
int event_base;
if(glXQueryExtension(display, &error_base, &event_base) != True) {
      printf("ERROR: GLX extension not supported for this X Server\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}

int glx_major_version;
int glx_minor_version;
if(glXQueryVersion(display, &glx_major_version, &glx_minor_version) != True) {
      printf("ERROR: glXQueryVersion() failed\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}
if( glx_major_version &lt; 1 || (glx_major_version == 1 && glx_minor_version &lt; 4) ) {
      /* The reason why we require GLX 1.4 (or higher, although it's doubtful a new version will be released) is because the GLX_ARB_create_context/GLX_ARB_create_context_profile extensions (which we need) requires GLX 1.4, and we need this extension in order to create a modern OpenGL context, which is what we are doing. "Modern" is somewhat of an outdated term as GLX 1.4 was released in 2005/2006, so there's nothing really unportable as we require the user to have hardware that can at least support this "modern" OpenGL. */
      printf("ERROR: GLX version is less than 1.4\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>With this code snippet, we query to see if the GLX extension to X11 is available for this X display using <span class="code_inline">glXQueryExtension()</span>. Then, we check which version of GLX is supported and we make sure it is at least 1.4, otherwise we won't be able to create a modern OpenGL context due to the <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span> extension requiring GLX 1.4, according to the documentation for the extension found <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/GLX_ARB_create_context.txt">here</a>.</p>

  <p>I won't be considering supporting old or legacy OpenGL in this tutorial, as I view that is a niche topic with less practical application.</p>



  <div class="he">Checking for GLX extensions</div>
  <p>After having made sure we have GLX 1.4 supported, we then need to check to see what extensions are supported. Some extensions are mandatory for creating a modern OpenGL context, but some are also very useful such as querying for swap control which gives us access to double-buffered vsync swapping. Note that GLX extensions are NOT the same thing as OpenGL or GL extensions, they are mutually exclusive with some exceptions. GLX extensions are properly extensions to GLX itself that gives you greater functionality, one of these extensions is <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span> which is necessary for a core OpenGL profile.</p>

  <p>To query for extensions we use the <span class="code_inline">glXQueryExtensionsString()</span> function, which gives us a space-seperated list of extensions that we can check through. It's a good idea to print out this string and check each extension for yourself to see what kinds of things GLX extensions accomplish.</p>

  <p>For our interests, we only care about two other extensions besides <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span>, which are <span class="code_inline">GLX_EXT_swap_control</span> and <span class="code_inline">GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear</span>. These two swap control extensions give us normal vsync and apative vsync respectively. We don't strictly need them, so you can decide whether they are required for your application or not.</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ Checking for GLX extensions */
const char* glx_extensions_string = glXQueryExtensionsString(display, default_screen_id);      

/* @NOTE: GLX_ARB_create_context_profile is absolutely neccessary in order to create a GL context, we cannot proceed without it. Technically, we need only check if GLX_ARB_create_context is supported rather than GLX_ARB_create_context_profile, because the former implies the latter is supported, IF the implementation supports OpenGL 3.2 or later, but we are definitely using a version higher than OpenGL 3.2, version 4 actually. Still, just in case, we explicity check if GLX_ARB_create_context_profile is supported to be as robust as possible. See this documentation for more details: https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/GLX_ARB_create_context.txt, specifically check the "Dependencies on OpenGL 3.2 and later OpenGL versions" section. */
if(search_str_in_str(glx_extensions_string, "GLX_ARB_create_context_profile") != TRUE) {
      printf("ERROR: \"GLX_ARB_create_context\" extension not supported, cannot create GL context!");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}
/* EXT_swap_control give us the ability to synchronize the swap (v-sync) by an integer amount of frames greater or equal to 0. */
if(search_str_in_str(glx_extensions_string, "GLX_EXT_swap_control") != TRUE) {
      printf("ERROR: \"GLX_EXT_swap_control\" extension not supported!");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}
/* This allows us to use adaptive v-sync for when we miss a swap by specifying negative integer intervals. Adaptive vsync is a generally a good compromise with double-buffering. This extension depends upon the GLX_EXT_swap_control extension to be available/supported. */
if(search_str_in_str(glx_extensions_string, "GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear") != TRUE) {
      printf("ERROR: \"GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear\" extension not supported!");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>The <span class="code_inline">search_str_in_str()</span> function can be whatever you want, but all it does is find if a string is contained within another string.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, that's basically it for searching for GLX extensions. You can check for any other additional extensions if you like, but we'll be sticking with these three.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Loading GLX extension procedures</div>
  <p>All GLX/GL extensions add functionality in one way or another. Some of them just change how things work, but some of them add new procedures that we have to load at runtime. These are not available at runtime precisely because they are extensions, so depending on the platform, they may or may not be available. Not only that, but the way they are implemented is also different depending on the driver's implementation.</p>

  <p>Supposedly, extensions should function as they are described by the standards, but in reality, there is not universal consistency and sometimes things don't work as expected. This is annoying, but we have to deal with this as graphics programmers and just do our best.</p>

  <p>The most important extension is the <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span> extension which gives us the function <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span>, which is what we need to use to create a modern (core profile) OpenGL context.</p>

  <p>Since <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> is an extension procedure, we need to load it with function pointers. But how can we load this function? It turns out, GLX provides us with a function <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddress()</span> which allows us to load both GLX extension procedures AND OpenGL (GL) extension procedures. There is also the similar <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddressARB()</span> function, which only differs in the "ARB" suffix. The ARB function is the extension function, as this used to be an extension to GLX but is now integrated into GLX 1.4 as a main function.</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ loading GLX extension procedures (we need the "glxext.h" header for the function typedefs and declarations). */
PFNGLXCREATECONTEXTATTRIBSARBPROC glXCreateContextAttribsARB = NULL;

  <p>Along with loading the <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> proc, we also load the <span class="code_inline">glXSwapIntervalEXT()</span> proc which allows use to specify a swap interval, giving us the ability to control vsync. Of course, since drivers can override this feature (such as if a user forcibly disables vsync in their control panel for their graphics card), then we can't ensure that it actually works exactly as we request it.</p>

  <p>Also, make sure you add <span class="code_inline">#include &lt;GL/glxext&gt;</span> which is the extension header for GLX that gives us the extension procedure typedefs and many other useful things. Make sure to include it AFTER the <span class="code_inline">#include &lt;GL/glx.h&gt;</span> otherwise it won't compile.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Selecting GLX framebuffer config</div>
  <p>Now that we have the GLX extension procedure(s) loaded, we need to start thinking about creating a window or framebuffer. We need to create an X11 window that is also compatible with OpenGL rendering, specifically with things like double buffering and other information.</p>

  <p>To accomplish this, GLX provides something called a <i>framebuffer config</i> or <span class="code_inline">GLXFBConfig</span>, which encapsulates the information we need to create a consistent window/framebuffer between OpenGL and X11.</p>

  <p>Our task is therefore to select a suitable <span class="code_inline">GLXFBConfig</span>, and we can ask for specific settings such as the size of the GL depth buffer, color-bit depth, double-buffering enabled, etc., to get a set of fb configs that match our desired settings:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ selecting a GLX FB Config */

int fbc_attribs[] = {
      GLX_LEVEL, 0,
      GLX_DOUBLEBUFFER, True,

XFree(fb_configs);
/* @! */</div>

  <p>The <span class="code_inline">fbc_attribs</span> is an array of pairs, where the first item is a symbolic constant specifying the attribute, and the second item is the value for that attribute.</p>

  <p>There are many attributes here, I won't go over all of them but some are important which I will detail here:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="code_inline">GLX_DOUBLEBUFFER</span> is a boolean setting for whether we want to have doublebuffering or not. We set it to True because we want double buffering, which is generally what you want.</li>
    <li><span class="code_inline">GLX_RED_SIZE</span>, <span class="code_inline">GLX_GREEN_SIZE</span>, and <span class="code_inline">GLX_BLUE_SIZE</span> set the bit-depth of the red, green, and blue color channels respectively. We want 8-bit color here which is fairly normal, so we set all channels to 8.</li>
    <li><span class="code_inline">GLX_DEPTH_SIZE</span>, and <span class="code_inline">GLX_STENCIL_SIZE</span>, are the sizes of the depth buffer and stencil buffer respectively, which we set to 24 and 8, for a total of 32-bits.</li>
  </uL>

  <p>The other settings are important too, check the GLX/Xlib documentation to see what they mean and to see what the other attribs are.</p>

  <p>Once we have our attrib array, we need to pass that into the <span class="code_inline">glXChooseFBConfig()</span> function and see if there are any frambuffer configs on the system that matches our requested attributes. The call to <span class="code_inline">glXChooseFBConfig()</span> will return a list of GLXFBConfigs or NULL on failure. Then, we just pick the first <span class="code_inline">GLXFBConfig</span> out of the list and save it for later.</p>

  <p>Once we are done, we can free the <span class="code_inline">fb_config</span> array with <span class="code_inline">XFree()</span>. If you're wondering why you can't find <span class="code_inline">XFree()</span> in the GLX 1.4 spec, it's because it's not there. <span class="code_inline">XFree()</span> is an Xlib function, which may seem weird as to why we're using an Xlib function for an array returned by a GLX function. But don't forget, GLX is just an <i>extension</i> to Xlib/X11, so it operates on the same basic inherited things that Xlib does, such as memory mangament in this case. Another thing GLX inherits are the Xlib boolean definitions <span class="code_inline">True</span> and <span class="code_inline">False</span>, which are seperate from my own personal <span class="code_inline">TRUE</span> and <span class="code_inline">FALSE</span>.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Creating an X11 Window and GLX Window</div>
  <p>Finally we have what we need to create the Window, the main subject of this tutorial along with an OpenGL context.</p>

  <p>To create an X11 window, we need to use the framebuffer config from before, and we also need to configure some other X11 attributes. We also need to create a GLX window after, which is basically just a pointer to the X11 window that we have, but it does accomplish some specific things. I've seen tutorials and people on the internet claim that the <span class="code_inline">GLXWindow</span> type is essentially useless, but this is far from true. More on that later anyways.</p>

  <p>The code to do all this is:</p>
  
  <div class="code_block">/* @@ creating X11 Window and GLX window */
Window parent_window = XDefaultRootWindow(display);
Window window;
int window_width = 960;
int window_height = 540;

XVisualInfo* visual_info = glXGetVisualFromFBConfig(display, best_fb_config); /* this GLX function gives us the structure we need to pass into X11 window create function so that our GLX fb config is consistent with the X11 window config. */
if(visual_info == NULL) {
      printf("ERROR: glXGetVisualFromFBConfig() failed to get a XVisualInfo struct\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}

XSetWindowAttributes window_attributes;
window_attributes.background_pixmap = None;
window_attributes.background_pixel = XWhitePixel(display, default_screen_id);

Colormap cmap = XCreateColormap(display, parent_window, visual_info->visual, AllocNone);
window_attributes.colormap = cmap;

window = XCreateWindow(display, parent_window, 0, 0, (unsigned int)window_width, (unsigned int)window_height, 0, visual_info->depth, InputOutput, visual_info->visual, CWBackPixmap | CWBackPixel | CWColormap, &window_attributes);
window_exists = TRUE;
XFree(visual_info);


/* now we create the GLX window which is basically just a handle to our X11 window, but it does accomplish very important things so we absolutely need it */
/* we need to use the same exact FB config as used to create the context AND to create the X11 window, so we just pass that in here as well. */
GLXWindow glx_window = glXCreateWindow(display, best_fb_config, window, NULL);
glx_window_exists = TRUE;

/* from now we use glx_window instead of window for any GLX/GL functions. For normal X functions, we continue to use the normal X window. */
/* @! */</div>

  <p>Firstly, we need to get a X11 Visual Config from our previous fb config with the <span class="code_inline">glXGetVisualFromFBConfig()</span> function. It may seem pointless that we have the fb config in the first place when we just convert it to an <span class="code_inline">XVisualInfo</span> struct, but the GLX fb config is necessary for the GLX window, and especially for creating an OpenGL context.</p>

  <p>Then, we need to fill out a <span class="code_inline">XSetWindowAttributes</span> struct which contains some basic properties. I've only set some basic stuff here like making the window white by default, and getting rid of a backgound pixmap which we don't need.</p>

  <p>We also need a colormap which can be created by a call to <span class="code_inline">XCreateColormap()</span>. I just use the default colormap which is just taken from the parent window. We also need to pass in the <span class="code_inline">visual</span> attribute from the <span class="code_inline">visual_info</span> struct we created from the GLX fb config.</p>

  <p>With those set, we can pass those into the <span class="code_inline">XCreateWindow()</span> function and finally get our window. We also pass in other settings, like the window width and height. Once we have the window we can free the <span class="code_inline">visual_info</span> struct with <span class="code_inline">XFree()</span>.</p>

  <p>Along with the X window, we also need to create a GLX window which is very simple and only requires a call to <span class="code_inline">glXCreateWindow()</span>, and we need to pass in our GLX fb config which we created earlier, as well as the X window we just created.</p>

  <p>From then on, any GLX functions should only use the <span class="code_inline">glx_window</span> variable instead of the X window variable. Use of the latter instead of the former is incorrect, but that is what is commonly seen in many tutorials such as these. Later, I'll go into depth as to why this is necessary. For Xlib functions, use the X window rather than the GLX window.</p>

  <p>Also, since we created the X window and GLX window, we should clean them up in the cleanup section which will now look like this:</p>

     <div class="code_block">     /* @@ cleanup and program exit */
CLEANUP_AND_EXIT:
     if(glx_window_exists == TRUE) {
	   glXDestroyWindow(display, glx_window);
     }
     if(window_exists == TRUE) {
	   XDestroyWindow(display, window);
     }
     if(display_exists == TRUE) {
	   XCloseDisplay(display);
     }

     return 0;
     /* @! */</div>

  <p>If you compile the code, the window won't be visible yet because we haven't made the neccessary call to <span class="code_inline">XMapRaised(display, window)</span> which will display our window and raise it to the top. Even doing this won't work because the X server hasn't synced it's request, so we need to do that with the call: <span class="code_inline">XSync(display, False)</span>, but even then you won't see the window just yet. The window will close as soon as it opens, so we need to add a sleep() call or something like that to see the window.</p>

  <p>You could do this if you want to see the window and make sure that it is working, but delete that code for later because we'll handle this in a different way.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Creating a GLX Context (OpenGL context) and making it current</div>
  <p>Now we can create an OpenGL context, and we do this with GLX. If it's confusing as to why an OpenGL context is created with GLX rather than OpenGL itself, that's because OpenGL doesn't "exist" at this point without a context, so something that doesn't exist cannot create itself. Sure, we can include the GL headers, but the actual context state has not been created yet. Furthermore, much about the context or context state is implementation or platform dependent, so it must be created at runtime, hence the need to create a GL context.</p>

  <p>Creating a <i>modern</i> OpenGL context or <i>core profile</i> context is only supported as a (GLX) extension, specifically, the <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span> we queried for earlier is needed to do so. The Windows equivalent for this is <span class="code_inline">WGL_ARB_create_context_profile</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_create_context_profile</span> gives us the extension procedure <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> which is what we need to use for a modern or core profile OpenGL. GLX also provides the functions <span class="code_inline">glXCreateNewContext()</span> and <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContext()</span>, but these functions are for OLD pre-modern OpenGL, so we don't want to use them.</p>

  <p>To create the context, we use the <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span> function as so:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ Creating GLX (GL) context, and making context current. */
int context_attribs[] = {
      /* @@ with GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB and GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_MINOR_VERSION, the context creation function may actually give us a higher version as long as it is backwards compatible, so we need to query the real OpenGL version with glGet.

      GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB, 6,
      /* @! */

      None
};

GLXContext glx_context = glXCreateContextAttribsARB(display, best_fb_config, NULL, True, context_attribs);
if(glx_context == NULL) {
      printf("ERROR: failed to create glx context with glXCreateContextAttribsARB()\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
} else {
      glx_context_exists = TRUE;
}

if(glXIsDirect(display, glx_context) != True) {
      printf("ERROR: OpenGL Context was NOT created in direct mode (DRI). It is not supported to run a networked X server setup with the client and server not on the same device. Otherwise, some other error occured.\n");
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
}

if(glXMakeCurrent(display, glx_window, glx_context) != True) {
      printf("ERROR: failed to make context current\n");	    
      goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
} else {
      glx_context_current = TRUE;
}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>First, we fill in an array of attribs <span class="code_inline">context_attribs</span>, which mostly just sets the OpenGL profile major and minor version. Then we pass that, along with our fb_config and some other variables into <span class="code_inline">glXCreateContextAttribsARB()</span>. The <span class="code_inline">NULL</span> is passed in because we don't want to use any shared contexts (we only want one context for this application), and the <span class="code_inline">True</span> is passed in to indicate that we want a Direct Rendering context which is very imporant, we need that if we want any chance of having decent performance.</p>

  <p>Next, we check to make sure using <span class="code_inline">glXIsDirect()</span> that our context is indeed direct, otherwise we exit with failure. Reasons for failing include that the display is not a local X server, or that there are other contexts on the system taking up the max amount of direct contexts supported.</p>

  <p>Finally, we make the context current by a call to <span class="code_inline">glXMakeCurrent()</span> passing in our context, GLX window, and display. This will not work properly with a normal X window, you need to create and use a GLX window.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we need to add this to our cleanup section:</p>
<div class="code_block">     /* @@ cleanup and program exit */
CLEANUP_AND_EXIT:
     if(glx_context_current == TRUE) {
           /* This function releases the current context when called with appropriate parameters, we have to first make the context not current or released/unbound to be able to destroy it properly */
	   glXMakeContextCurrent(display, None, None, NULL);
     }
     if(glx_context_exists == TRUE) {
	   glXDestroyContext(display, glx_context);
     }
     if(glx_window_exists == TRUE) {
	   glXDestroyWindow(display, glx_window);
     }
     if(window_exists == TRUE) {
	   XDestroyWindow(display, window);
     }
     if(display_exists == TRUE) {
	   XCloseDisplay(display);
     }

     return 0;
     /* @! */</div>

  <p>We just added here to make the context uncurrent and then destroy it.</p>

  <p>At this point we are technically done, but there are still a couple of other things.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Loading OpenGL procedures</div>
  <p>Now that we have a window and opengl context, let's create a little example program to demonstrate that it works properly.</p>

  <p>Firstly, to use many OpenGL procedures, they need to be loaded at runtime. We load GL procedures just like GLX procedures, and there is also a similar extension header to include that is <span class="code_inline">&lt;GL/glext.h&gt;</span>, but we also need to include the headers for OpenGL itself which is <span class="code_inline">&lt;GL/gl.h&gt;</span>, and we also need to link to GL with <span class="code_inline">-lGL</span> in GCC.</p>

  <p>Once that is done, we can load GL procedures with the following code. I haven't loaded every function, but these are a couple of functions that we'll be using for the rest of the tutorial along with some others:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ loading OpenGL procedures (we need the "glext.h" header for the function typedefs and declarations, "glext.h" and "glxext.h" are NOT the same, they are spelled very similar but the former is for OpenGL and the latter is for GLX). */

/* @! */</div>

  <p>Note that some functions like <span class="code_inline">glClear()</span> do not need to be loaded because they are old functions, part of the original OpenGL version. It's only newer procedures (that were once purely extensions, and hence are loaded at runtime) that have to be loaded like this.</p>

  <p>People keep complaining about how hard it is to load GL procedures, but it's literally as simple as I have shown you. There are a lot of other caveats, such as checking the GL version and extension to make sure that certain functions are available, but the core idea is fairly simple.</p>

  <p>Considering that OpenGL will not be updated, and that we've had 4.6 for almost a decade now, it won't be that difficult to determine which extensions are generally present on most systems. Obviously vendor-specific extension procedures will need to be queried for in a different manner, but the core OpenGL version 4 functions are going to be pretty much available everywhere.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Configuring Window/Framebuffer Settings</div>
  <p>There are a couple of Window settings we can configure before we get to actual GL rendering. We can set the name of the window, ask X11 to receive certain events (keyboard input), and also turn on vsync:</p>

<div class="code_block">/* @@ configuring window parameters */
XStoreName(display, window, "X11 OpenGL Window");
XSelectInput(display, window, KeyPressMask); /* so we can get keyboard inputs in the X11 event loop */

/* even though we checked to see if the extension is present, we should still check again with glXQueryDrawable() to make sure it is there. This is a robust and defensive way of programming that you need to do. */
unsigned int query_val;
glXQueryDrawable(display, glx_window, GLX_LATE_SWAPS_TEAR_EXT, &query_val);
if(query_val == 1) { /* late swaps is supported, i.e. adaptive v-sync */
      glXSwapIntervalEXT(display, glx_window, -1); /* -1 is adaptive v-sync */	    
      glXQueryDrawable(display, glx_window, GLX_SWAP_INTERVAL_EXT, &query_val);
      if((int)query_val != -1) { /* even again here we check to make sure it was set properly */
	    printf("ERROR: failed to set swapinterval val correctly. \"-1\" was requested but we did not get it\n");
	    goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
      }
} else {
      glXSwapIntervalEXT(display, glx_window, 1); /* 1 is normal v-sync */
      glXQueryDrawable(display, glx_window, GLX_SWAP_INTERVAL_EXT, &query_val);
      if(query_val != 1) {
	    printf("ERROR: failed to set swapinterval val correctly. \"1\" was requested but we did not get it\n");
	    goto CLEANUP_AND_EXIT;
      }
}

glViewport(0, 0, window_width, window_height);  
/* @! */</div>

  <p>First we give our window a name with <span class="code_inline">XStoreName(display, window, "X11 OpenGL Window")</span>, and then we ask it to get keyboard input with <span class="code_inline">XSelectInput()</span> and the <span class="code_inline">KeyPressMask</span> flag.</p>

  <p>Then using <span class="code_inline">glXQueryDrawable()</span>, we double check if what the extensions support is actually there, just to be safe. Depending on what seems to be supported, we either select for late swapping (adaptive vsync) or normal vsync. We set the swap interval with the GLX extension provided procedure <span class="code_inline">glXSwapIntervalEXT()</span>.</p>

  <p>Lastly, we set the GL viewport with <span class="code_inline">glViewport()</span>.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Basic OpenGL Hello Triangle</div>
  <p>As an example, just to prove that this whole tutorial does indeed work - let us setup a basic hello triangle example with OpenGL.

      XEvent event;
      while(num_events > 0) {
	    XNextEvent(display, &event);

      glFinish(); /* blocks until all previous GL commands to finish, including the buffer swap. */

}
/* @! */</div>

  <p>In the loop, we first clear the framebuffer with <span class="code_inline">glClear()</span>. Then, we use <span class="code_inline">XFlush()</span> to flush the X buffer so that we can get access to the latest events, such as keyboard input or window events.</p>

  <p>We then get the number of events with <span class="code_inline">XEventsQueued()</span>, it's important that we specify <span class="code_inline">QueuedAlready</span> instead of something like <span class="code_inline">QueuedAfterFlush</span>, because we are manually flushing ourselves with <span class="code_inline">XFlush()</span>, so we don't need to use <span class="code_inline">QueuedAfterFlush</span>.</p>

  <p>Once we have the number of events in the event queue, we simply read off that number of events in a loop with the <span class="code_inline">XNextEvent()</span> function which returns the next event. Be careful when calling the <span class="code_inline">XNextEvent()</span> function, because it will block if there are no events in the queue and wait until another event comes. For some applications this behaviour is desirable, but for a realtime application such as a graphics engine, we definitely do not want that.</p>

  <p>In our case, we just check if there is keyboard input and kill the program if there is by setting <span class="code_inline">running = 0</span>. Then, we do some basic OpenGL rendering using the setup before.</p>

  <p>The last two things in the loop is to swap the buffers and then synchronize with <span class="code_inline">glFinish()</span>. <span class="code_inline">glXSwapBuffers()</span> will behave as according to how we controlled the swap interval with <span class="code_inline">glXSwapIntervalEXT()</span>. If we set the swap interval to <span class="code_inline">0</span>, then it would not try to synchronize to the refresh rate or vertical blank whatsoever.</p>

  <p>Calling <span class="code_inline">glFinish()</span> here is not usually seen, but it is important to understand that the <span class="code_inline">glXSwapBuffers()</span> function does not block or wait for the buffer swap to be complete, all the function does is queue up a buffer swap and lets the driver decide when to actually make the swap (according to vsync rules primarily). If you just call this function without a call to <span class="code_inline">glFinish()</span>, then you might end up queuing subsequent frames early, before the previous frame is visible. Worst-case scenario, you would be possibly a whole frame behind because you're simulation/rendering runs much faster than the refresh rate.</p>

  <p>Synchronization is out of scope for this post, but suffice to say, a call to <span class="code_inline">glFinish()</span> will block until the buffers are swapped. I do not claim to be an expert on this, but for more information, see <a href="https://community.khronos.org/t/swapbuffers-and-synchronization/107667">this</a> blog post.</p>

  <p>And that's it! I'll provide the full source code at the end of the page and the GCC options to compile.</p>


  
  <div class="he">Addendums</div>
  <p>There are a couple of extra points I want to clarify or expand upon that were hinted in the post.</p>

  <div class="hes">glXGetProcAddress vs glXGetProcAddressARB</div>
  <p>So it may be confusing which of these functions to use. For one, the author(s) of the official Khronos API doesn't even seem to know what to use, as according to this <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Load_OpenGL_Functions">link</a>:</p>

  <div class="qte">The function glXGetProcAddress (or glXGetProcAddressARB; it is not entirely clear as to which should be used) retrieves function pointers on X-Windows-based systems.</div>

  <p>So that's not much help, but I've done some digging myself on the matter.</p>

  <p>The <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddressARB()</span> function was written against the GLX 1.3 specification, as evidenced by <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/GLX_ARB_get_proc_address.txt">this</a> documentation for the <span class="code_inline">GLX_ARB_get_proc_address</span> extension. However, in the GLX 1.4 spec, the <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddressARB()</span> function was promoted to the core <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddress()</span> function. You can find this in the "GLX Versions" section of the GLX 1.4 spec which is at the very end. Therefore, if we use GLX 1.4 (which we are), then we can just use <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddress()</span>.</p>

  <p>If you want to support pre GLX 1.4 or legacy OpenGL, consider then using <span class="code_inline">glXGetProcAddressARB()</span>.</p>

  <div class="hes">GLXWindow vs X Window</div>
  <p>So a point I brought up was that we need to create a GLX Window, although some people disagree. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60795622/xlibs-window-vs-glxs-glxwindow-confusion">This</a> stackoverflow post is incorrect that the GLX window is "useless".</p>

  <p>For one, this GLFW <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/507">github issue</a> shows a request to use GLFW windows for GLX 1.4 support.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_swap_control.txt">documentation</a> for the swap control extension mandates that we need to query a GLX window rather than an X window for swap interval properties, otherwise it will not work correctly. Right from these docs:</p>

  <div class="qte">The current swap interval and implementation-dependent max swap interval for a particular drawable can be obtained by calling glXQueryDrawable with the attributes GLX_SWAP_INTERVAL_EXT and GLX_MAX_SWAP_INTERVAL_EXT respectively. The value returned by glXQueryDrawable is undefined if the drawable is not a <b>GLXWindow</b> and these attributes are given.</div>

  <p>And in my own testing, I found that using a normal X window instead of a GLX window cause errors just as this spec described. I would get incorrect values for the max swap interval, such as 0, when it returns a much higher number with a GLX window.</p>

  <p>Thirdly, if you try to set the swap interval without a GLX window, not only will it crash, but trying to do basic GL rendering won't even work at all.</p>

  <p>The bottom line is that you can't trust what you see on the internet. I understand that's rich coming from the author here, but I have also provided evidence for my claims.</p>
